# LinkedList
Implemented a templated doubly linked list class in C++ with a variety of methods. The methods included functionalities for addition and deletion of nodes at both head and tail, insertion of nodes before and after a certain node, insertion of node at a specific index, and searching for a specific node data. The class also supports several helper functions such as printing the linked list in forward and reverse order, clearing the list, and getting the node count. It also includes operator overloading for assignment (=), equality (==), and subscript([]) operations. Proper memory management is ensured with a custom destructor and copy constructor, and error checking for out-of-range indices.
